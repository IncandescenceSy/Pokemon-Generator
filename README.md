# Pokemon-Generator
Command line utility that generates a challenge command to be used with Pokemon Showdown that legalizes a specific, random subset of Pokemon.

## Usage

**This is a command line tool! Do not run the .exe file directly! Open a shell (Command Prompt, Bash, etc) and type commands to use it.**

`
pokemon_generator x
`

The first argument must match the name of the file, which should be pokemon_generator by default. x can be any number between 1 and 641. It will return a challenge command with that amount of randomly generated Pokemon lines legalized.
